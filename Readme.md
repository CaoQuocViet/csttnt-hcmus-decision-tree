Decision Tree Classifier

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch in Python. It is demonstrated using the Iris dataset.

(Include the image output.png here manually)

Project Structure
-----------------
- DecisionTree.py: Main script for building and evaluating the Decision Tree classifier.
- output.png: Demo result image.
- requirements.txt: Required Python libraries.
- venv: Virtual environment directory (not included in the repository).

Installation and Usage
-----------------------
1. Clone the repository
   To clone this repository, use the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/CaoQuocViet/csttnt-hcmus-decision-tree.git
   cd csttnt-hcmus-decision-tree

2. Set up a virtual environment
   Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies
   Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Decision Tree model
   After the dependencies are installed, you can run the Decision Tree classifier:
   python DecisionTree.py

5. View the output
   The output of the model's performance will be displayed in the terminal. The demo image `output.png` shows the result.
