# Decision Tree Classifier

## Introduction

This project implements a Decision Tree classifier using the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm from scratch in Python. The aim is to build a machine learning model that can classify the Iris dataset without relying on advanced machine learning libraries.

## Dataset

The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) is used for testing the algorithm. It is a widely recognized dataset for evaluating classification models.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/decision-tree-classifier.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd decision-tree-classifier
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Decision Tree classifier:**

    ```bash
    python DecisionTree.py
    ```

2. **Follow the prompts and review the output in the terminal to evaluate the model's performance.**
